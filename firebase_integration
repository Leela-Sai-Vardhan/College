## 🚀 User Flow

### First-Time Login Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" on StudentLoginPage
2. Google authentication completes
3. Roll number extracted from display name (first word)
4. Check if user exists in Firestore
5. If NEW USER:
   - Create Firestore document with basic info
   - Navigate to ProfileCompletionPage
   - User fills mandatory fields:
     * Phone (10 digits)
     * Date of Birth
     * Address
     * Branch
     * Semester
     * Section
     * Batch (auto-calculated 4-year gap)
   - Save to Firestore
   - Mark profile as completed
   - Navigate to StudentDashboard
6. If EXISTING USER:
   - Load data from Firestore
   - Update local UserModel
   - Check if profile completed
   - If NOT completed: Navigate to ProfileCompletionPage
   - If completed: Navigate to StudentDashboard
```

### Profile Edit Flow:
```
1. User navigates to Profile Section
2. Clicks edit icon in AppBar
3. Navigate to EditProfilePage
4. User can edit:
   - Phone, Address, DOB (Personal Info)
   - Branch, Semester, Section, Batch (Academic Info)
5. Read-only fields (Email, Roll Number) displayed but disabled
6. Save changes updates both Firestore and UserModel
7. Show confirmation and return to Profile
```

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Roll Number Auto-Extraction
- Extracts first word from Google account display name
- Format: `238W1A04K9` (23 = year, 8W1A = branch/section, 04K9 = student number)
- Stored as read-only field

### 2. Profile Completion Tracking
- Calculates completion percentage (11 key fields)
- Shows progress bar in Profile Section
- Fields tracked:
  * Username, Email, Phone, Address, DOB
  * Roll Number, Branch, Semester, Section, Batch
  * Profile Picture

### 3. Validation Rules
- **Phone**: Exactly 10 digits, numeric only
- **Roll Number**: Auto-extracted, non-editable
- **Batch**: 4-year gap auto-calculated (e.g., 2023-2027)
- **Email**: From Google account, non-editable

### 4. Semester Results Display
- Shows overall CGPA prominently
- Expandable cards for each semester
- Subject-wise breakdown with grades
- Color-coded performance indicators

## 📝 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Dependencies
Ensure `pubspec.yaml` has:
```yaml
dependencies:
  firebase_core: ^3.9.0
  firebase_auth: ^5.3.4
  cloud_firestore: ^5.6.0
  firebase_storage: ^12.3.7
  google_sign_in: ^6.2.2
  provider: ^6.0.1
  image_picker: ^1.1.2
```

### Step 2: Replace Files
1. Copy all artifact code to respective files
2. Update imports if package name differs
3. Ensure `assets/images/default_user_icon.png` exists

### Step 3: Update Imports
In files that use the profile section, add:
```dart
import 'package:vrsec_admin/pages/edit_profile_page.dart';
import 'package:vrsec_admin/pages/semester_results_page.dart';
```

### Step 4: Test Flow
1. Delete app data (or use new test account)
2. Sign in with college Google account
3. Verify roll number extraction
4. Complete profile with all fields
5. Test profile editing
6. Verify data persistence

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Firestore Security Rules (Recommended):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Users can read/write only their own data
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Storage Security Rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /profile_pictures/{userId}.jpg {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Roll Number Not Extracted
**Solution**: Ensure Google account display name format is correct (e.g., "238W1A04K9 Student Name")

### Issue 2: Profile Picture Upload Fails
**Solution**: Check Firebase Storage rules and ensure bucket name is correct

### Issue 3: Data Not Persisting
**Solution**: Verify Firestore rules allow write access for authenticated users

### Issue 4: Provider Not Found Error
**Solution**: Ensure `ChangeNotifierProvider` wraps `MaterialApp` in `main.dart`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Phase 2 Enhancements:
1. **Admin Panel**: Faculty can edit student academic info
2. **Hostel Management**: Add hostel leave requests
3. **Real-time Sync**: Use Firestore streams for live updates
4. **Offline Support**: Cache data locally
5. **Notifications**: Push notifications for results/attendance
6. **Batch Operations**: Upload results via Excel/CSV
7. **Analytics**: Track profile completion rates

### Additional Features:
- Parent portal integration
- Fee payment gateway
- Document uploads (ID cards, certificates)
- Grievance/complaint system
- Library management
- Transportation tracking
